            This is a very <strong>strong</strong> text,
            because it is <strong>bold</strong>.<br>
            The title for the book is <u>The Great Escape</u>.<br>
            The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were
            thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli,
            but the Little Blind Text didnâ€™t listen. She packed her seven versalia, 
            put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way

            I would like to <em>emphasize</em> how important it is to follow through with your plans.<br>
            Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries 
            Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated 
            they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, 
            a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their
            place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia.
